# Crucibilistic : <br> <u> A crossword solver, maybe.</u>.

### Probabilistic attempt at crossword solving.

This is a new updated version of my TIPE project for the entrance contest of
ENS.
This is a passion project I work on during my free time.
The version of the project I presented for my TIPE is available on the `tipe`
branch, although I don't reckon anyone should look at whatever that is.
